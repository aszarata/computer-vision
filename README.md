# Digital Image Processing and Analysis - Labs (AGH 2024)

This repository contains a collection of laboratory exercises along with reports for the **Digital Image Processing and Analysis** course at AGH University of Science and Technology (Informatics, 2024).

## Labs:
1. **Edge Detection and Smoothing** – Canny edge detection, gradient analysis using Sobel filter  
2. **Image Classification** – Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
4. **Object Detection** – YOLO (You Only Look Once)  
5. **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)**  
6. **Vision Transformers (ViT)**
